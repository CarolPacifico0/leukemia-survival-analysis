 Leukemia Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier Curve)

This project uses a publicly available leukemia dataset to demonstrate how to perform survival analysis using Python.

ðŸ“Š **Methods:**
- Kaplan-Meier estimator
- Log-rank test
- Chi-square interpretation
- Visualizations with Matplotlib

 **Key learning points:**
- Statistical â‰  Clinical significance
- Importance of context in interpreting survival data
- Impact of censored observations and hazard ratios

 This project is educational and exploratory only. 
The dataset source and clinical details are unknown, so interpretations are limited.
